A notable example is the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1607.00133\">differentially-private stochastic gradient descent<\/a>&nbsp;(DP-SGD) algorithm. This algorithm trains ML models over multiple iterations \u2014 each of which is differentially private \u2014 and therefore requires an application of the composition property of DP. A basic composition theorem in DP says that the privacy cost of a collection of algorithms is, at most, the sum of the privacy cost of each. However, in many cases, this can be a gross overestimate, and several improved composition theorems provide better estimates of the privacy cost of composition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, we released an&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/developers.googleblog.com\/2019\/09\/enabling-developers-and-organizations.html\">open-source library<\/a>&nbsp;(on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/google\/differential-privacy\">GitHub<\/a>) to enable developers to use analytic techniques based on DP. Today, we announce the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/google\/differential-privacy\/commit\/b4b26475acce0be9b7e9844db4af5a1b9929cab1\">addition<\/a>&nbsp;to this library of&nbsp;<em>Connect-the-Dots<\/em>, a new privacy accounting algorithm based on a novel approach for discretizing&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/petsymposium.org\/popets\/2019\/popets-2019-0029.pdf\">privacy loss distributions<\/a>&nbsp;that is a useful tool for understanding the privacy cost of composition. This algorithm is based on the paper \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/petsymposium.org\/popets\/2022\/popets-2022-0122.pdf\">Connect the Dots: Tighter Discrete Approximations of Privacy Loss Distributions<\/a>\u201d, presented at&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/petsymposium.org\/2022\/\">PETS 2022<\/a>. The main novelty of this accounting algorithm is that it uses an indirect approach to construct more accurate discretizations of privacy loss distributions. We find that Connect-the-Dots provides significant gains over other privacy accounting methods in literature in terms of accuracy and running time. This algorithm was also recently applied for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/ai.googleblog.com\/2022\/12\/private-ads-prediction-with-dp-sgd.html\">privacy accounting of DP-SGD in training Ads prediction models<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Featured image tecting<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":10,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[4,5],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":29,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5\/revisions\/29"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/10"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
